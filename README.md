# Apple-s-Design-Principles
### We aim to study Apple’s design philosophy and how it successfully created a brand name that’s synonymous with great design. We want to explore what design principles Apple products incorporate and connect them with Don Norman’s User centered design principles.

### Further, we critique Don Norman’s opinion of Apple’s recent product designs.

### Finally, we explore changes in design of Apple products during and after Steve Jobs’ reign as CEO.
